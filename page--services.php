                                    <h3>Choosing the right lens in your glasses</h3>
                                    <h4>Plastic</h4>
                                    <p>Plastic lenses are the most basic lens material that a prescription can be molded to. These lenses have poor clarity, are heavy and break with minimal impact force.</p>
                                    <h4>Polycarbonate</h4>
                                    <p>Polycarbonate lenses are thinner and lighter than plastic lenses. They are highly impact resistant and offer mild UV protection. Polycarbonate also has mild heat stress within the lenses and has an Abbe value of 30.</p>
                                    <h4>Trivex</h4>
                                    <p>Trivex is the lightest material and is 60x more impact resistant than plastic. It is also twice as scratch resistant as polycarbonate. The Abbe value is 43 and offers mild UV protection. This lens is suggested for most prescriptions from +3.00D to -4.00D.</p>
                                    <h4>Hi-index 1.67,1.70, 1.74</h4>
                                    <p>A Hi-index lens has a monomer structure that allows the lens to be exceptionally thin and light. This lens is suggested for prescriptions above +3.00D or above -4.00D. The lens is 15% thinner than a standard polycarbonate and 25% flatter.</p>
                                    <h4>Digital lens</h4>
                                    <p>Our IQ or digital lens combines a spherical front surface lens with a free form custom back surface lens. This lens expands peripheral viewing and allows superior clarity. This lens is highly recommended for high prescriptions and prescriptions with high astigmatism. The lens reduces distortions and aberrations to produce enhanced visual acuity.</p>
                                    <h3>Choosing the right Presbyopia lens</h3>
                                    <h4>Sync lens</h4>
                                    <p>An advanced single vision lens that allows one to focus at near with minimal effort. The bottom of the lens has a boost in power to allow the viewer to comfortably see print and objects at near. This lens can be fit in non-presbyopic patients who experience eyestrain from prolonged reading activities. Sync is most often fit in new Presbyopic patients whose accommodation is fluctuating in and out. This lens is much easier to adapt to than a bifocal or progressive.</p>
                                    <h4>Tact lens</h4>
                                    <p>An advanced lens that is designed to aid computer users and people who need a larger range of near vision than reading glasses. The lens relieves eyestrain and provides correction for intermediate (computer) and near (cell phones, tablets, books). The lens is highly adaptable and easy to use.</p>
                                    <h4>Lifestyle 2 Progressive</h4>
                                    <p>Lifestyle 2 is our top progressive that uses double surface technology to expand the field of view and allow a comfortable transition from distance to near. It has the best image definition and eliminates the swim sensation. This lens has over a 1,000 focal points and allows clarity from 20ft to 40cm.</p>
                                    <h4>Array digital Progressive</h4>
                                    <p>This is our everyday use progressive that is easily adaptable and a great value. Array is a free form back surfaced progressive that reduces distortion and optimizes the image. This lens is easy to maneuver and add coatings and treatments such as transitions, polarization and anti-reflective treatments.</p>
                                    <h4>Anti-reflective (AR) treatment</h4>
                                    <p>Recharge Anti-reflective treatment is our most recommended AR because it not only decreases reflections, but it reduces blue light (emitted from computers, TV and phones) from entering our eye. Studies have shown excessive blue light exposure can damage our retinal pigment epithelium. This AR is also water repellent, dirt repellent and scratch resistant. Most are unaware there are over 30 different AR coatings and many craze or peel off within a matter of months.</p>
                                    <p>We also highly recommend any of these options. Just ask one of our opticians.</p>

                                    <h3>Chooseing the right contact lenses</h3>
                                    <h4>Contact lenses</h4>
                                    <p>In a contact lens examination, we will analyze your corneal topography through the Kr1W wave-front analyzer. We will then find a contact lens that fits the curvature and size of your cornea. Because dry eye syndrome, eyelid disease and ocular allergies commonly affect the population, we will choose monthly, biweekly, or dailies based on the health of your eye.</p>
                                    <h4>Monthly Contacts</h4>
                                    <p>Monthly contacts are the most basic and most popular contacts the vast majority of the population wears. Monthly contacts are usually suggested in patients who are unaffected by dry eye and ocular allergies. There are specialized monthly contacts that have been approved to sleep in for 30 days. Monthly contacts are known to be thicker than biweekly or dailies. Though they are thicker, Avant-Garde only fits monthly contacts that have a high oxygen permeability and fit comfortably. These contacts are also the most affordable.</p>
                                    <h4>Biweekly Contacts</h4>
                                    <p>Biweekly contacts are fit when patients have mild cases of dry eye or when monthly contacts feel too thick and uncomfortable. These contacts have a great price point and are only a few dollars more than monthly contacts. Biweekly are also commonly fit in athletes and patients who work outside because most of the lenses have great UV protection and a comfortable edge design.</p>
                                    <h4>Daily Contacts</h4>
                                    <p>Dailies are our most popular and most recommended contacts. These contacts are the easiest to maintain and manage. With dailies, you open a new pair in the morning and throw them away at night. They are the thinnest and usually the most comfortable contacts. These contacts are suggested to anyone who suffers from moderate dry eye, ocular allergies, eyelid disease or for anyone who has damage on their cornea. Also, these are suggested for anyone with a medical condition that involves weak blood vessels, such as Diabetes and Hypertension.</p>
                                    <h4>Toric Contacts</h4>
                                    <p>Toric contacts are fit on anyone with an astigmatism higher than -1.00. In order to have good clarity, with high astigmatism, a patient must wear a contact lens that corrects 2 focal points. Toric contacts come in monthly, biweekly, and dailies.</p>
                                    <h4>Multifocal contacts</h4>
                                    <p>Multifocal contacts are fit in patients who have been diagnosed with presbyopia. Multifocal contacts allow a person to see distance, intermediate and near. The more a patient increases in presbyopia, the more multifocal contacts are suggested as a primary option. Multifocals allow people to see all distances with both eyes. The design and formula to maximize vision is different for each contact lens. The general pattern consists of a patient seeing distance in the middle of the pupil with a concentric ring of near around it and then another concentric ring of distance around that ring. These contacts have monthly, biweekly and daily options.</p>
                                    <h4>Monovision contacts</h4>
                                    <p>Monovision contacts are also fit in patients who have been diagnosed with presbyopia. This fit is different from multifocal contact lens because this fitting corrects one eye for distance and one eye for near. Monovision is commonly fit in presbyopic patients who have an astigmatism. Currently there is only one toric multifocal contact lens, but the vast majority prefer toric monovision contacts for increased clarity and minimal frustration. Monovision contacts can be fit with monthly, biweekly, dailies, toric and can be combined with multifocals.</p>
                                    <h4>Staff’s favorite contacts:</h4>
                                    <blockquote>“I am a huge fan of Acuvue Trueyes. These are the only lenses that are thin and moist enough to feel comfortable on my eye. I have chronic dry eye syndrome and I commonly get clogged Meibomian glands. These conditions make it difficult to comfortably wear contacts. I had to refit myself 5x because all the other contacts caused my eyes to feel dry. If you want a more comfortable lens try Acuvue Trueyes!” - Dr. Lee</blockquote>
                                    <blockquote>“I love Total Dailies because they feel the most comfortable on my eyes. These contact lens feel so hydrated that it feels like there is nothing there. After wearing them for 8 hours it feels the most moisturizing in comparison to the others. In the past, I have had bad experiences with other contact lenses where I would feel a foreign body sensation or dryness as soon as I put the contact on. Total dailies always feel fresh and clean, and after a long day I can simply throw them away. I like that I don’t have to clean them or worry about getting germs in my eyes. I always have a clean pair on hand.” - Anastasiia</blockquote>
                                    <blockquote>“I am a huge fan of Acuvue 1-day moist for astigmatism. Having an astigmatism and wearing contacts have always been an issue. I commonly experienced discomfort with other brands of contacts. Acuvue 1 day moist for astigmatism not only corrected the issue but also provided me with the best clarity. Past contacts made my eyes feel like they were constantly re-focusing. I rarely feel like my eyes are dry and exhausted from wearing contacts all day.” - Martha</blockquote>

                        <h3>Vision Insurance</h3>
                        <p>Most vision insurances have a standard copay for a comprehensive ocular evaluation. In this examination, we will obtain a new spectacle prescription, along with an explanation of how the new prescription will benefit a person’s life and visual needs. We will also perform an extensive evaluation of our patients’ external and internal ocular health.</p>
                        <h3>Need a contact lens fit as well?</h3>
                        <p>After the comprehensive ocular examination, we will analyze your corneal topography along with your tear film and pick a contact lens that will best suit your eyes. We will then dispense a trial contact lens for you to wear for a week. This ensures the vision and comfort is optimal for that lens. The contact lens fit will have a standard copay. The copay is usually varied depending on whether we are fitting in a spherical, toric or multifocal contact lens. The contact lens copay will be discussed before the start of the examination.</p>
                        <h3>Optical and contact lens dispensary</h3>
                        <p>After a glasses prescription is determined, an optician will help you find a glasses frame that will compliment your facial features and your style. We will then discuss the right lens that will give you the best clarity and comfort. Vision insurance gives you a specific monetary value off the frame and/or a specific percentage off. The lenses and lens coatings are given at a contracted rate that has been negotiated by your insurance. Usually the lenses have set copays or set percentages off.
For contacts, your insurance takes a specific monetary value off a year’s supply of contacts. An optician will go over the price of a year supply and 6 month supply of contacts after your benefits are applied. Occasionally, vision insurances combine your contact lens benefits to go towards your contact lens fit AND your contacts materials. If it is a combined benefit we will let you know how much money is left to go towards your contact lens materials.</p>
                        <h3>Medical Insurance</h3>
                        <p>If we are in network with your medical insurance, we will call your insurance and see what the copay for a specialist office visit is. Because optometrists are specialists, you may need a referral from your primary care physician. For most medical insurances, the copay does not apply until the deductible and/or the out of pocket has been met. If it has not been met, we will let you know how much the deductible and out of pocket has been met so far.</p>

                        <h3>Glaucoma</h3>
                        <p>Glaucoma is a chronic and degenerative disease that damages the optic nerve, resulting in vision loss and blindness. High ocular pressure is closely related to the extent of damage on the optic nerve. Glaucoma causes you to lose peripheral vision and if it goes undiagnosed, it will eventually affect your central vision. Because glaucoma is a slowly progressing disease, there are no visual symptoms. It usually takes 1-3 years of consistent IOP measuring and visual field testing to diagnose a patient. Glaucoma cannot be cured but can be managed with IOP lowering drops or with surgery.</p>
                        <h3>Cataracts</h3>
                        <p>Cataracts are commonly an age related disease that affects people over the age of 50. Cataracts are a clouding of the intraocular lens that causes blurred vision and an increase in glare. This is the leading cause of blindness around the world.  The types of cataracts include nuclear cataracts (the most common), which develops in the center of the lens, cortical cataracts develop and grow like spokes on a wheel, and posterior subcapsular cataracts develop in the back of the lens. Cataracts can be treated with surgery.</p>
                        <h3>Macular Degeneration</h3>
                        <p>Age related macular degeneration is a disease that causes vision loss in the central vision. It damages the macula which is the part of the eye that allows you to see small sharp details in your central vision. Macular degeneration can develop slowly and cause trace to moderate decreased vision. As time goes by the blurred spot can get bigger and colors will appear less vibrant and objects will be less bright. Blindness can happen with severe and aggressive cases of macular degeneration and must be treated with ocular injections. Age related macular degeneration cannot be cured but can be prevented and minimized by not smoking and taking Lutein vitamins.</p>
                        <h3>Diabetic Retinopathy</h3>
                        <p>Diabetic Retinopathy is a condition that causes damage to blood vessels in the back of your eye and occurs when the blood sugar is not controlled. This disease is seen in people who have too much sugar in their blood. Diabetic retinopathy is first seen when small blood vessels leak blood, then later leak additional fluids. The leakage will cause the retina to become inflamed and will cause vision to fluctuate in and out of focus. Diabetic retinopathy treatment usually includes lowering blood sugar. Severe cases will require a retinal laser.</p>
                        <h3>Retinal holes/tears</h3>
                        <p>Retinal holes and tears happen when layers of the retina begin to weaken or are stretched thin. There are usually no symptoms associated with holes and tears but some will report large colorful flashes of light followed by a new onset of floaters. Others have reported a dark curtain or shadow looming in the periphery. Holes and tears are commonly seen in people with a high near sighted prescription, people with ocular trauma and/or people who recently had eye surgery. Holes and tears are treatable with numerous retinal procedures that can involve retinal lasers or freezing tissue.</p>

                        <h2>Different types Refractive errors</h2>
                        <h3>Myopia</h3>
                        <p>Myopia or nearsightedness, is a type of refractive error where light is focused in front of the retina. It is the in-ability to see objects at distance clearly. This is the most common refractive error. If myopia is untreated, it can cause squinting, eyestrain, fatigue and headaches. Myopia manifests when the eye grows too long. It usually starts in early childhood and stabilizes in adulthood. Myopia is treated with glasses, contact lenses, or LASIK surgery.</p>
                        <h3>Hyperopia</h3>
                        <p>Hyperopia or farsightedness, is a type of refractive error where light is focused behind the retina. People notice objects at near are blurry while objects at distance are clear. Common signs and symptoms of hyperopia include headaches, eyestrain, squinting, or blurred vision at near. Hyperopia is commonly missed in vision screenings, but can be discovered in a comprehensive eye exam. It can be corrected with glasses, contact lenses or LASIK.</p>
                        <h3>Presbyopia</h3>
                        <p>Presbyopia is a common vision disorder that occurs around the age of 40. It is an age related condition and occurs because the lens of the eye becomes thicker and loses flexibility to focus and accommodate. Presbyopic eyes lose the ability to see objects at near. The condition can be corrected with readers or prescription eyeglasses as well as multifocal or monovision contact lenses. Presbyopia is rarely corrected with LASIK surgery.</p>
                        <h3>Astigmatism</h3>
                        <p>Astigmatism is a type of refractive error where light is focused on multiple points of the retina. Because there are several focal points, vision is blurred at near and distance. Astigmatism commonly causes eyestrain after prolonged visual activities. It can be caused by an irregularly shaped cornea or an irregularity within the lens behind your eye. Astigmatism can be corrected through glasses or contact lenses.</p>
